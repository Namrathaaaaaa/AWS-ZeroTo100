# AWS EC2 Instance Types and Use Cases

Amazon EC2 provides a wide selection of instance types optimized for different use cases. Each instance type offers varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.

---

## üîπ 1. General Purpose Instances

Balanced CPU, memory, and networking resources.

| Instance Family | Description | Use Cases |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| `t4g`, `t3`, `t3a`, `t2` | Burstable performance instances | Small applications, development environments, low-traffic websites |
| `m7g`, `m6i`, `m5`, `m5a`, `m5n` | Balanced compute, memory, and networking | Web servers, small-to-medium databases, backend servers |

---

## üîπ 2. Compute Optimized Instances

Ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors.

| Instance Family | Description | Use Cases |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| `c7g`, `c6g`, `c6i`, `c5`, `c5a` | High compute-to-memory ratio | High-performance web servers, batch processing, scientific modeling, ad serving |

---

## üîπ 3. Memory Optimized Instances

Designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.

| Instance Family | Description | Use Cases |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| `r7g`, `r6g`, `r6i`, `r5`, `r5a` | High memory-to-compute ratio | In-memory databases (Redis, Memcached), real-time big data analytics |
| `x2idn`, `x2iedn`, `x1e`, `x1` | Extra high memory | SAP HANA, large-scale in-memory applications |
| `z1d` | High compute and high memory | Electronic design automation, financial modeling |

---

## üîπ 4. Storage Optimized Instances

Designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage.

| Instance Family | Description | Use Cases |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| `i4i`, `i3`, `i3en` | High IOPS from NVMe SSD | NoSQL databases (Cassandra, MongoDB), OLTP systems |
| `d3`, `d2` | Dense HDD-based storage | Data warehousing, Hadoop, distributed file systems |

---

## üîπ 5. Accelerated Computing Instances

Use hardware accelerators or co-processors to perform functions such as floating-point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching.

| Instance Family | Description | Use Cases |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| `p5`, `p4`, `p3` | NVIDIA GPUs for ML and HPC | Deep learning training/inference, GPU computing |
| `inf2`, `inf1` | AWS Inferentia chips | Low-latency ML inference workloads |
| `trn1` | AWS Trainium chips | ML model training at scale |
| `g5`, `g4ad`, `g4dn` | NVIDIA GPUs for graphics | Game streaming, 3D rendering, ML inference |
| `f1` | FPGA-based | Custom hardware acceleration (e.g., genomics, encryption) |

---

## üîπ 6. High Memory Instances

Specifically designed for large in-memory databases like SAP HANA.

| Instance Family | Description | Use Cases |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| `u-6tb1`, `u-9tb1`, `u-12tb1` | 6, 9, or 12 TB of RAM | Enterprise-grade in-memory databases, real-time analytics |

---

## üìù Choosing the Right Instance

- **General Purpose**: For most everyday workloads (start with `t` or `m` series).
- **Compute Optimized**: When CPU-bound processing is the bottleneck.
- **Memory Optimized**: For large in-memory datasets.
- **Storage Optimized**: When local storage speed is key.
- **Accelerated Computing**: For specialized compute tasks like ML, video rendering.
- **High Memory**: For enterprise-grade in-memory applications like SAP HANA.

---

## üìå Notes

- Many instance types have variants optimized for networking (e.g., `n`, `dn`), or arm-based processors (`g` - Graviton).
- Always check the **latest generation** of an instance family for better performance and price efficiency.
- Use **Savings Plans** or **Spot Instances** for cost optimization where applicable.
